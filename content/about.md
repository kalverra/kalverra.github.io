![Me](/images/head_shot.jpeg)

I'm Adam, a Software Engineer currently working on [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) (anything I say is personal opinion, etc...). You can check out my work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kalverra) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-hamrick-8b1866116/).

Partially wanting to improve my writing, and partially inspired by [this Paul Graham essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html), I decided to start this. I’m making it public to force some accountability. And who knows, maybe someday I’ll say something interesting enough that someone other than my mom will want to read it.

## What I'm Doing Now

1. :man_office_worker: Working on [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), namely focusing on improving our quality standards, automated testing and release process, and ensuring that we actually work on all the chains we want to work on. It's hard, interesting work that I'm passionate about.
2. :graduation_cap: Taking [MIT's Distributed Systems](https://github.com/kalverra/mit-distributed-systems) course on my weeknights. I've learned a lot of these concepts as a consequence of work, but feel a more formal, academic approach could be helpful.
3. :person_lifting_weights: I've taken up regular weightlifting again after a long hiatus of injury, laziness, and COVID.
4. :book: [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110709291-adam-hamrick) when I can. Right now it's sporadic, and focused on making myself more productive, but hopefully I'll allow myself to read some fiction again.

## What I Want to Do Soon

1. [More reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/110709291?shelf=to-read), my pile grows infinitely. Specifically I want to take another crack at [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications) which I got about a quarter of the way through and had to stop as I was absorbing so little. It demands a far more attentive read.
2. More rigorous crypto study, specifically I've heard that Stanford's [Cryptography 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) and [2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto2) are great courses.
3. [Diving into the EVM](https://blog.qtum.org/diving-into-the-ethereum-vm-6e8d5d2f3c30) after I've got some more Solidity chops.
4. [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/) to help cultivate my ever-present-but-never-executed ambitions to strike out with my own company.
