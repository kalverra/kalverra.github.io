Maybe this essay exists solely for my own benefit of organizing my thoughts and feelings on the matter, or maybe someone else will find this enlightening as well.</p><p>I was recently diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist and my primary care doctor who concurred. I’m 28 years old and was never flagged as ADHD before, but I suspect that is largely because I was in environments that were maybe not the best at recognizing or even acknowledging the existence of ADHD. Here are some myth-busting and baseline premises I’ve discovered as part of this process.</p><ul><li>ADHD is a real thing that affects how your brain works. It has been <a href=https://www.additudemag.com/brain-mri-scans-adhd-research/>picked up in brain scans</a> (though <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7879851/>it’s not fully settled on how that works yet</a>), and we can reliably diagnose it by looking at the repeated behaviors of those who have it.</li><li>It is commonly diagnosed in children but can be discovered and diagnosed in adults. (There are some rumblings of <a href=https://add.org/can-adhd-appear-for-the-first-time-in-adulthood/>adult-onset ADHD being a thing</a>, but most people think it’s adults that never got diagnosed.)</li><li>The concept of ADHD has been around since <a href="https://www.notion.so/Therapy-and-ADHD-b0935a99286841ab8c0800ff234760bc?pvs=21">the early 1900s</a>. There are some theories that our current environment of overwhelming technology has contributed to its existence (I’m currently surrounded by four computer monitors and a cell phone, all buzzing notifications at me), but there’s no definitive word on that yet, and it’s certainly not the only cause.</li><li><a href=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html>About 13% of U.S. boys are diagnosed</a>, and 6% of girls. However, there is <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8042533/>some agreement that we’ve been a bit too trigger-happy with that diagnosis</a>.</li><li>It is genetic. If one of your parents has it, there’s a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Therapy-and-ADHD-b0935a99286841ab8c0800ff234760bc?pvs=21">roughly 35% chance you do</a>.</li><li>There are a few different treatment approaches, but behavioral interventions (<a href=https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique>Pomodoro timers</a>, <a href=https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done>GTD method</a>) + stimulant medications (Adderall, Vyvanse, etc) seem to be by far the most effective.</li><li>“Adderall/Vyvanse/Whatever is just giving kids meth” is… well <a href=https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/know-your-amphetamines>kind of true</a>. Though there’s a massive difference between taking a dose or two of highly controlled and regulated Adderall in the morning and shoving crystal meth up your butt for 3 days straight, they’re chemically very similar.</li></ul><h2 id=what-is-it>What Is It?

A brain’s default process looks for information all around it, noticing everything it can. When it finds an idea or a sensation it wants to focus on, it quiets this primary process and gives way to a focused process that can shut out the noise around it and dive deep into that area for a limited amount of time. When that focus process is finished, or runs out of energy to continue, the primary process re-asserts itself and starts looking for something new to focus on. Occasionally there’s a bug or misunderstanding, and the primary and focus processes get out of sync. They both try to run at the same time or not at all. So while you’re trying to read a book or finish something at work, a million other things are going through your mind. Or your brain feels so blocked and empty that your only desire is to lay motionless in a dark room. This is an annoying occurrence for neurotypical people, but is a way of life for ADHD people. Also it’s suspected ADHD people have <a href=https://www.thinkkids.com/blog/how-adhd-contributes-to-memory-problems>less RAM</a> than most others.</p><h2 id=why-do-i-think-i-have-it>Why Do I Think I Have It?

Also, the more I learn about <a href=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878>common symptoms</a> and listen to the stories of others with ADHD, all of these things match my experience to an uncanny degree. Some that match with me particularly:</p><ul><li>Easily overwhelmed when faced with what most would consider a reasonable task list.</li><li>Extreme difficulty concentrating on any one thing, even things I enjoy like TV, books, and video games. It’s easy to feel restless and reach out for the next thing, and the internet is an especially dangerous tool to have here. I’ll start something at work I’m excited about, then some other random thought will enter my mind, and in no time, the day will be done. I’ll be watching two videos in the background about system design while reading some esoteric article on poisonous frogs. Even as I write this, I’ve switched my attention to a bunch of random, unconnected topics. I’ve also jumped around the essay itself, writing a couple sentences in one spot and then jumping halfway down the page to elaborate on some other point.</li><li>Except sometimes when my brain decides something is unbelievably fascinating, so much so that I’ll forget to shower or eat because I need to know every detail about how dogs’ noses work. Most people refer to this as <a href=https://add.org/adhd-hyperfocus/>hyperfocus</a>.</li><li>Hearing the phrase “wasted potential” a lot as a kid.</li><li>Constantly forgetting appointments, where I put my keys, how to get home, and the names of people I’ve known for weeks.</li><li>I can never seem to finish anything. My history is littered with assignments, hobbies, and projects that all are close to the finish line, but never made it.</li><li>I have a hard time getting to sleep because I’m always thinking of <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/top/>random bullshit that I need to know about NOW</a>.</li><li>I’m constantly fidgeting with something, getting up to pace, or generally being restless.</li><li>I have multiple relatives, including both my mother and grandmother, who have either official diagnoses or match a lot of the above symptoms.</li><li>I was recently prescribed Adderall, and it was such an emotional experience I cried with joy at the end of the day, a reaction that is nearly ubiquitous among ADHD people and not all that common among others.</li></ul><p>When listing these symptoms, it’s common for people to say things like, “I forget my keys and get distracted sometimes too. That doesn’t mean I’m ADHD,” to which you’d be right. Human brains are all broadly similar. We all get sad, distracted, and prideful sometimes. But there’s a difference between experiencing something occasionally and experiencing something almost always. Everyone gets sad, but not everyone is depressed. Everyone gets distracted, but not everyone has ADHD. Everyone has moments of pride, but not everyone is a narcissist. But when these things happen every day, so much so that your wife is frequently mad at you because of your inability to remember plans or appointments; or you need to designate a specific place in your house where your keys and wallet go, otherwise you will lose countless time every day looking for them, you’ve established a pattern of behavior that indicates your brain works differently than others.</p><h2 id=why-am-i-not-fully-convinced-i-do>Why Am I Not Fully Convinced I Do?

Even if we over-diagnose ADHD in the U.S., it’s still not a tiny probability. The lowest estimate I could find for ADHD <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916320/>occurrence in my demographic was 6.76%</a>, which is a slightly higher chance than rolling a one on a d20 die. If you’ve played enough Dungeons and Dragons, you know from personal experience that those odds are small, but they’re sure as shit not impossible.</p><h3 id=i-dont-match-all-of-the-symptoms>I Don’t Match All of the Symptoms

The stereotypical ADHD kid is always hyper-energy, can never sit still, is always getting in trouble, and has abysmal grades. A lot of adult ADHD sufferers also deal with impulsiveness and its consequences, like terrible credit scores, gambling debt, or an inordinately high amount of jobs and relationships.</p><p>I was never a troublemaker as a kid, and while my grades were never spectacular, I typically excelled in English and History while underperforming in almost everything else. No one ever flagged me as ADHD when I was a kid<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. As an adult, I’ve made a few impulsive decisions here and there, but am relatively boring.</p><p>This is all true, but it ignores the fact that a diagnosis of something does not require the presence of every single symptom. I’ve undeniably had COVID-19 at least three times. I displayed a lot of symptoms, but I never felt one of the most common COVID symptoms: a shortage of breath. That doesn’t mean I never had COVID; I have multiple tests to disprove that assumption.</p><h3 id=i-could-be-fooling-myself>I Could Be Fooling Myself

It’s a tendency for people to interpret very general statements about the human experience as having deep personal insight into themselves. Statements like “You have a tendency to be critical of yourself” and “You have a great need for other people to like and admire you” are general enough they apply to everyone, but when you hear them it’s common to think it describes you in particular and feel a deep emotional reaction. It’s how psychics and mind readers <a href=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1224176/psychic-services-market-size-us/>make so much money</a> tricking you into thinking they have a particularly deep insight into your pysche.</p><p>But ADHD symptoms don’t seem to have that quality. There are some that are pretty general like, “You often feel overwhelmed when a lot is expected of you at once”, but others that are much more specific like, “You find it incredibly difficult to finish a task, even if the hardest parts are already done” or “You often feel overly active and compelled to do things, like you were driven by a motor.”</p><h2 id=why-is-it-a-problem>Why Is It a Problem?

Why is it something worth fixing?</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dUNWW2D3BM">This Ken Robinson talk</a> about education and ADHD makes a good point about how we see ADHD as a problem not because our brains are built wrong, but because the education system is. Society has been designed in overt and subtle ways to move all of humanity into some narrow pathways, pathways that don’t play to the strengths of ADHD people. While I can’t reform society, I can try finding a different niche within it.</p><p>The problem is that I’m already in a niche considered nearly optimal for ADHD people. Being a software developer plays to many of ADHD’s strengths, where we can bounce around the walls learning 15 different things a day and then spend a week holed up doing nothing but hyper-focusing on a program. But it’s still an issue for me. My focus is scattered and unpredictable. It’s preventing me from where I want to go in my life and career, and it’s been something both my teammates and I have been frustrated with.</p><p>It also makes me anxious and <a href=./working-through-depression.md>depressed consistently</a>. I always end the day tired because I was “working” all day, but I get very little done. So I’m exhausted, disappointed with myself, depressed at how little progress I’m making, and anxious for the next day. It’s been an unpleasant way of existing, and I thought it was normal for so long. To find out that it’s not has been a revelation.</p><h2 id=how-do-i-fix-it>How Do I Fix It?

I’m blessed with a flexible schedule, but it’s not flexible enough to let me sit around all day and wait for inspiration. So I need to focus (hehe) on solving that aspect. Other parts of my ADHD have proven useful in my life and career, being able to swap between a ton of things with little friction has led me to some interesting learning experiences.</p><h3 id=the-usuals>The Usuals

In children, they can even help change the structure of your brain over time so that ADHD doesn’t really bother you in adulthood anymore, which is badass. But for those of us who missed that boat, drugs are pretty much unavoidable for the rest of our lives.</p><p>There are some non-stimulant medications you can take to help improve ADHD symptoms. <a href=https://www.additudemag.com/wellbutrin-for-adhd/>Wellbutrin</a> is a depression medication that’s handy for this. It can also help with anxiety and depression, which tend to come packaged with ADHD. It didn’t do much for me, though.</p><p>The <a href=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/treatment.html>obvious gotos</a> after that are <a href=https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/know-your-amphetamines>amphetamines like Adderall and Vyvanse</a>. There’s a litany of different kinds, but they all do the same thing. For me, my first time on Adderall was a revelation akin to taking LSD for the first time. For the first time in my life, my brain was quiet. I didn’t get distracted all day by random bullshit, and at the end of the day, I was pleased. I finished a task from start to end, multiple tasks even! A feat that on a typical day seems impossible.</p><p>There are some risks to <a href=https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/28/adderall-risks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/>using Adderall</a>. Dependency is the one I’m most concerned with. I’m still confused about what “addiction” means in this context. From Scott Alexander:</p><blockquote><p>The data on this are really poor because it’s hard to define addiction. If a prescription stimulant user uses their stimulants every day, and feels really good on them, and feels really upset if they can’t get them…well, that’s basically the expected outcome.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve heard anecdotally about people who become so dependent on Adderall that they become depressed zombies for long periods when they lose access to it. Given that amphetamine shortages <a href=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/adhd-drug-shortage-adderall-ritalin-focalin-vyvanse-rcna137356>aren’t exactly rare events</a>, this is a real issue to consider. However, these stories tend to involve individuals with severe cases of ADHD. Before Adderall, they had so many issues in their interpersonal and professional lives that the possibility of dependence is more than worth the risk. Others can function fine if they miss a dose and regularly skip doses on weekends and vacations. I’m still new to this game but have found this strategy to be the best approach for me so far.</p><p><figure><img src=/images/do-i-have-adhd/focus_hours.png alt="My tracked focus hours at work.

I think I&rsquo;m ready to accept that. This was informative mostly for my own psyche, but on the miniscule chance that someone actually finds this, perhaps it can help them figure it out like I did. If you&rsquo;re in that position, I will say I wish I had tried the scarier sounding interventions like Adderall sooner. It was akin to wearing glasses for the first time, and not at all how I expected it to be. It&rsquo;s also tempting to think that discovering and treating something like this will ultimately &ldquo;fix&rdquo; you. It won&rsquo;t, but it will help a whole lot.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>This could easily be due to the environment I was in at the time.
